3. **Fill Product Details:**

**Product Name:** CareerJump

**Tagline:**
```
Career change after 40? Talk to someone who's actually done it.
```

**Description:**
```
Most career advice is written by 28-year-olds who've never pivoted. CareerJump connects you with mentors who changed careers after 40 — people who know what it's like to start over when you have a mortgage, kids, and doubts.

No corporate fluff. No LinkedIn hustle culture. Just real conversations with people who've been exactly where you are.

What you get:
• 1-on-1 mentorship from professionals who pivoted after 40
• Story-first matching (not algorithm-based résumé parsing)
• Warm, realistic guidance — like talking to a friend who gets it
• Practical advice on navigating ageism, imposter syndrome, and financial risk

Who it's for:
Mid-career professionals (38-55) who are ready for something new but don't want platitudes from someone half their age.

Hey PH! I'm Ash, and I built CareerJump after watching too many talented people in their 40s get generic career advice from people who've never walked in their shoes.

The idea hit me when a friend (43, sales director, wanting to pivot to UX) told me: "Every mentor I talk to is either 26 and full of theory, or 60 and retired. I need someone who's IN IT right now."

So I built this. CareerJump matches you with mentors based on your story — not keywords. You get paired with someone who actually pivoted in their 40s, in a similar field, with similar life constraints.

No SaaS corporate vibe. No hustle porn. Just warm, real conversations with people who know that starting over at 42 feels different than starting over at 22.

We're live at https://careerjump.ashketing.com

Would love your feedback, especially if you've ever felt like career advice wasn't written for you.

## Day 2: Twitter/X Launch Thread

### Timing
**Tuesday or Thursday, 9:00 AM EST**

### Steps

1. **Compose Thread** (9 tweets total)

**Tweet 1/9:**
```
Most career advice is written by people who've never actually changed careers in their 40s.

I built something to fix that. 

Let me tell you why. 👇
```
*Attach: `social-twitter.png` or Product Hunt thumbnail*

**Tweet 2/9:**
```
A friend (43, sales director → UX) told me:

"Every mentor I find is either 26 and full of theory, or 60 and retired. I need someone who's IN IT right now."

That hit hard. Career change at 42 ≠ career change at 22.
```

**Tweet 3/9:**
```
When you pivot mid-career, you're dealing with:
- Ageism in interviews
- Financial risk (mortgage, kids, life)
- Imposter syndrome ("am I too old to start over?")
- LinkedIn hustle culture (which... doesn't help)

You need real talk. Not platitudes.
```

**Tweet 4/9:**
```
So I built CareerJump.

It's a mentor-matching platform specifically for mid-career pivots (38-55).

You get paired with someone who ACTUALLY changed careers after 40 — in a similar field, with similar life constraints.
```
*Attach: Screenshot of homepage hero*

**Tweet 5/9:**
```
How it works:
✅ Story-first matching (not algorithm-based résumé parsing)
✅ Mentors who pivoted recently (they remember what it's like)
✅ Warm, realistic guidance (like talking to a friend who's been there)
❌ No corporate SaaS vibes
❌ No hustle porn
```

**Tweet 6/9:**
```
Example:

You're 44, finance → nonprofit. You get matched with someone who made that exact pivot at 46.

They tell you:
- How they handled the pay cut
- How they explained the gap to their family
- What actually worked in interviews

Real. Useful. Human.
```

**Tweet 7/9:**
```
I'm not saying this replaces therapy or financial planning.

But if you're mid-career and thinking "I want something new, but I have no idea how to start" — talking to someone who's BEEN THERE changes everything.
```

**Tweet 8/9:**
```
We're live today: https://careerjump.ashketing.com?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=feb2026

If you're 38-55 and considering a pivot (or you've made one recently and want to mentor), check it out.

Genuinely just trying to fill a gap I kept seeing. Feedback very welcome.
```

**Tweet 9/9:**
```
tl;dr:

Career advice for people over 40 shouldn't come from people who've never done it.

CareerJump = mentor matching for mid-career pivots.

Story-first. Warm. Real.

## Day 3: Reddit — r/careerchange

### Timing
**Tuesday or Thursday, 8:00-10:00 AM EST**

### Steps

1. **Go to:** https://www.reddit.com/r/careerchange/

2. **Create Post:**

**Title:**
```
[43F] Changed careers last year. Built a tool to help others do the same. Here's what I learned.
```

**Post Body:**
```
I pivoted from sales to UX at 43. It was terrifying, messy, and nothing like the LinkedIn success stories make it sound.

The hardest part wasn't learning new skills — it was finding advice that actually applied to my life. Most career coaches are either:
- 26 and full of theory
- 60 and retired (helpful, but different generation)

I needed someone who was IN IT. Someone who'd recently navigated ageism in interviews, imposter syndrome, and the financial risk of starting over with a family.

So I built CareerJump. It's a mentor-matching platform specifically for mid-career pivots (38-55). You get paired with someone who:
- Actually changed careers after 40
- Worked in a similar field or made a similar transition
- Gets what it's like to start over when you have real constraints

No corporate SaaS vibe. No hustle culture. Just warm, realistic conversations with people who've been where you are.

It's live now: https://careerjump.ashketing.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=careerchange&utm_campaign=feb2026

Happy to answer questions about the pivot process or the tool itself. Honestly just hoping this helps someone avoid the "generic LinkedIn advice" trap I fell into.
```

3. **Monitor & Engage:**
   - Reply to ALL comments within 2 hours
   - Answer questions thoroughly
   - Be genuine, not salesy
   - No promotional follow-ups

## Day 4: Reddit — r/careerguidance

### Timing
**Wednesday, 8:00-10:00 AM EST**

### Steps

1. **Go to:** https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/

2. **Create Post:**

**Title:**
```
Built a mentor-matching tool for career changers over 40. Feedback welcome.
```

**Post Body:**
```
I kept seeing posts here from people in their 40s asking for career change advice, and the responses were... not always age-appropriate.

"Just do a bootcamp!" (Ok, but I have a mortgage and can't afford to not work for 3 months.)
"Network more!" (I've been networking. It's harder when recruiters see your graduation year.)

So I built CareerJump — a platform that matches mid-career professionals (38-55) with mentors who actually pivoted after 40.

The idea: pair you with someone who RECENTLY made a similar career change, so they remember what it's like. Someone who can give you real talk about:
- How they handled the financial risk
- How they dealt with ageism in interviews
- How they rebuilt confidence after years in one field
- What actually worked vs. what sounded good on LinkedIn

Story-first matching (not algorithm-based). Warm, realistic tone (not corporate fluff).

Live at: https://careerjump.ashketing.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=careerguidance&utm_campaign=feb2026

If you're considering a pivot or have made one recently, I'd love your feedback. Trying to make this genuinely useful, not just another SaaS product.
```

3. **Monitor & Engage:** (same as r/careerchange)

## Day 5: Reddit — r/40something

### Timing
**Thursday, 8:00-10:00 AM EST**

### Steps

1. **Go to:** https://www.reddit.com/r/40something/

2. **Create Post:**

**Title:**
```
Anyone else feel like career advice isn't written for us?
```

**Post Body:**
```
I'm 43 and considering a career change. Every article I read is either:
- Written for fresh grads
- Written BY someone who's never actually done it mid-career
- Full of platitudes ("follow your passion!" — cool, but I have kids and a mortgage)

I wanted to talk to someone who GETS IT. Someone who changed careers after 40 and can tell me the real version — not the sanitized LinkedIn version.

Couldn't find that, so I built it: https://careerjump.ashketing.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=40something&utm_campaign=feb2026

CareerJump matches you with mentors who actually pivoted in their 40s. You get paired based on your story, not keywords. The goal is to have the kind of conversation you'd have with a friend who's been there — honest, warm, realistic.

Not trying to sell anyone. Just genuinely think there's a gap in the "career advice for grown-ups" space and wanted to fill it.

Anyone else ever feel this way? Or am I just cynical? 😅
```

3. **Monitor & Engage:** (same as others)
