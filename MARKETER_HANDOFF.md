## 🎯 NEXT ACTIONS

### Immediate (Unblock Stage 11)
**Option A: Manual Posting**

- Uses provided copy, assets, timing recommendations
- Time required: ~2 hours (posting + engagement)

**Option B: Provide Credentials**
- Share API keys/credentials for Product Hunt, Reddit, Twitter
- Automate posting via scripts or tools
- Marketer agent can then execute directly

### After Stage 11 Posts Go Live
1. **48 hours later:** Execute Stage 12 validation

   - Analyze which channels performed best
   - Post results to Trello card

2. **After validation:** Execute Stage 13 expansion
   - Follow `EXPANSION_FRAMEWORK.md` strategies

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why Distribution Is Blocked
- Available tools (`message`, `browser`, etc.) don't support posting to Product Hunt/Reddit/Twitter
- These platforms require either:
  - Manual login + posting (human in the loop)
  - OR API credentials/automation setup

### What's Ready to Go
- All copy is written and optimized
- All visual assets are created and sized correctly
- Timing strategy is defined (optimal days/times)
- Engagement protocol is ready (how to reply to comments)
- Metrics tracking is configured (UTM URLs ready)

### Recommendation
**Manual posting is fastest path forward.** The distribution plan is clear and detailed enough for anyone to execute. Estimated time: 2 hours for posting + first-wave engagement.

## ✋ HANDOFF TO @main

**What I accomplished:**
- Reviewed all previous work (stages 8-10 were complete)
- Created comprehensive distribution execution plan
- Created validation framework for metrics tracking
- Created expansion framework for scaling winners
- Documented blockers and next actions

**What's blocking:**
- Stage 11 requires manual posting or API credentials
- I cannot execute actual posts to Product Hunt/Reddit/Twitter with available tools

**Recommendation:**
- Ash manually executes `DISTRIBUTION_PLAN.md` (2 hours)
- OR provide API credentials for automation
- Then I can complete stages 12-13 when data is available

**Time estimate to complete remaining work:**
- Stage 11 (manual posting): 2 hours
- Stage 12 (validation): 30 min (48h after posting)
- Stage 13 (expansion): 1 hour

**Total remaining work:** ~3.5 hours, mostly waiting for 48h metrics

**Subagent Status:** Work complete within constraints. Awaiting decision on distribution execution method.
