## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Complete Design System Created
- **Typography:** Crimson Text (serif display) + Inter (body) + JetBrains Mono (data)
- **Color Palette:** Terracotta (#D4735E) + Sage Green (#8B9D83) + Warm Grays
- **Components:** Buttons, cards, forms, accordion, all specified with exact CSS
- **Motion:** Staggered reveals, scroll animations, hover states

### ✅ Full Site Map Designed
- Landing page (7 sections: hero, stories, how-it-works, mentors, pricing, FAQ, footer)
- Mentee quiz (/find-mentor) — 5 questions, one per screen
- Mentor intake (/become-mentor) — long-form conversational form
- Thank you page (/thank-you) — post-submission

### ✅ Page-by-Page Wireframes
- Desktop + mobile layouts for every page
- ASCII wireframes showing component placement
- Responsive behavior documented (breakpoints: 1024px, 768px, 480px)
- Mobile-first strategy with specific fixes

### ✅ Custom Visual Assets Generated
All images created with nano-banana-pro (NOT stock photos):

1. **hero-journey.png** (2K, 5.2MB) — Abstract path from corporate to creative landscape
2. **feature-icons.png** (1K, 1.1MB) — 4 minimalist icons (compass, handshake, path, plant)

### ✅ Design Documentation

## The Unforgettable Element

**First-person story opening:**

> "At 44, I had 18 years in education. Zero tech experience.  
> And a mortgage that didn't care about my dreams."

This immediately validates the target audience's fears and positions CareerJump as HUMAN-FIRST, not corporate-polished SaaS.

---

## Design Differentiation

### What Competitors Do (Avoided):
- Purple/blue gradients on white
- "AI-powered matching" buzzwords
- Dashboard screenshots
- Circular avatar grids
- Stock photos of professionals shaking hands
- Generic "Find your mentor" hero copy

### What CareerJump Does:
- Story-first landing page with real pivot case studies
- Warm terracotta + sage green (NOT SaaS blue)
- Quote-first mentor intros (NOT profile grids)
- Salary transparency in case studies
- NPR podcast aesthetic (thoughtful, conversational)
- Manual curation positioned as feature, not limitation

---

## Handoff to @coder

**Ready for implementation:**
- Complete design system with exact colors, fonts, spacing
- shadcn/ui component list
- Mobile-responsive wireframes
- All visual assets generated
- Accessibility requirements documented

**Tech Stack (from planner):**

- Vercel deployment

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Landing page (validates concept)
2. Mentee quiz (lead generation)
3. Mentor intake (Google Form fallback OK)
4. Thank you page (simple)

**Build Time Estimate:** 18-24 hours (from planner)

## Core Insight

This is NOT a typical SaaS landing page. It's designed to look like a thoughtful NPR feature about career transitions. The warmth comes from:
- Serif headlines (gravitas)
- Earthy colors (approachable, not corporate)
- Real stories with salary transparency (honest, not hyped)
- Conversational tone (friend who's been there, not consultant)

**The product personality:** "Warm realism — like talking to a friend who's been there."
